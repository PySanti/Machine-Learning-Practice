# Machine learning practice


The idea of this repository is to **practice my incipient knowledge in the area of machine learning**.

I will take a real dataset from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu) and the goal is to build a **meta-model** able to perform a super high prediction rate, based on the **stacking** strategy in the context of **ensemble learning**. The following algorithms will be implemented (it will be a classification problem):

 * Logistic Regression
 * SVC (with its linear, rbf and polynomial kernel variants)
 * Random Forest.

In addition, several preprocessing strategies will be implemented such as: 

* Use of **Imputers** to handle missing values
* **OneHotEncoding** to handle categorical variables
* Correlation analysis
* Sampling bias analysis
* Use of Scalers for normalization or standardization of numerical variables (if applicable).
